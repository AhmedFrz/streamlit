# Streamlit Web Apps Portfolio

Welcome to my Streamlit web apps portfolio! In this repository, you'll find three distinct applications that showcase my skills in building interactive and data-driven web applications using the Streamlit framework.

## 1. Sign-up Page
The Sign-up Page is a simple yet elegant web application that allows users to create an account. It features the following functionality:

- **Sign-up Form:** Users can input their username, password, and email address.

- **Profile:** Photo Upload: Users can upload a profile photo in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.

- **Preview:** After submitting the form, the user's information and uploaded photo are displayed in a centered and visually appealing layout.

### Business Relevance of Sign-up Page:

**1. Customer Acquisition:** The sign-up page can be used to onboard new customers for e-commerce platforms, SaaS products, or online services, helping businesses acquire and retain users.

**2. Lead Generation:** The sign-up page can be integrated into marketing campaigns to capture leads, which can then be nurtured and converted into paying customers.

**2. User Authentication:** The sign-up page can be part of a robust user authentication system, ensuring secure access to business-critical applications and data.

## 2. Graphical Calculator
The Graphical Calculator is an interactive application that allows users to plot various mathematical functions. Key features include:

- **Equation Input**: Users can enter mathematical expressions (e.g., x^2, 2*x, x^3) to be plotted.

- **Range Selection**: Users can specify the starting and ending values for the x-axis, as well as the color of the graph.

- **Interactive Plotting**: The application generates an interactive plot that can be resized and explored within the Streamlit interface.

### **Business Relevance of Graphical Calculator**:  

**1. Financial Analysis:** The graphical calculator can be used by financial analysts to visualize and analyze trends, forecast future performance, and make data-driven investment decisions.

**2. Engineering Design:** Engineers can leverage the graphical calculator to plot and analyze complex mathematical functions, aiding in the design and optimization of products, systems, or processes.

**3. Scientific Research:** Researchers in various scientific fields can use the graphical calculator to plot experimental data, test hypotheses, and communicate findings more effectively.

## 3. Data Quality Reporting
 The Data Quality Reporting application leverages the power of the ydata-profiler library to provide comprehensive data quality analysis. Users can:

- **Upload Data**: Users can upload a CSV file or connect to a PostgreSQL database to analyze their data.

- **Automated Reporting**: The application generates an interactive HTML report that provides detailed insights into the data, including variable analysis, missing value detection, and data distribution.

- **Report Rendering**: The generated report is seamlessly integrated into the Streamlit application, allowing users to view and explore the data quality insights directly within the web interface.

### Business Relevance of YData_Profiler

**1. Data Governance**: The data quality reporting application can be used by data governance teams to regularly assess the quality of the organization's data assets, ensuring compliance with data policies and regulations.

**2. Business Intelligence**: Data analysts and business intelligence professionals can use the data quality reports to identify and address data issues, leading to more reliable and actionable insights for decision-making.

**3. Data-driven Operations**: Departments across the organization, such as sales, marketing, or supply chain, can leverage the data quality reports to improve the integrity of the data they rely on for operational decisions and process optimization.
