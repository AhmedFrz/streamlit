# Streamlit Web Apps Portfolio

Welcome to my Streamlit web apps portfolio! In this repository, you'll find three distinct applications that showcase my skills in building interactive and data-driven web applications using the Streamlit framework.

## 1. Sign-up Page
The Sign-up Page is a simple yet elegant web application that allows users to create an account. It features the following functionality:

- Sign-up Form: Users can input their username, password, and email address.

- Profile Photo Upload: Users can upload a profile photo in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.

- Preview: After submitting the form, the user's information and uploaded photo are displayed in a centered and visually appealing layout.
  
## 2. Graphical Calculator
    The Graphical Calculator is an interactive application that allows users to plot various mathematical functions. Key features include:

- Equation Input: Users can enter mathematical expressions (e.g., x^2, 2*x, x^3) to be plotted.

- Range Selection: Users can specify the starting and ending values for the x-axis, as well as the color of the graph.

- Interactive Plotting: The application generates an interactive plot that can be resized and explored within the Streamlit interface.

## 3. Data Quality Reporting
 The Data Quality Reporting application leverages the power of the ydata-profiler library to provide comprehensive data quality analysis. Users can:

- Upload Data: Users can upload a CSV file or connect to a PostgreSQL database to analyze their data.

- Automated Reporting: The application generates an interactive HTML report that provides detailed insights into the data, including variable analysis, missing value detection, and data distribution.

- Report Rendering: The generated report is seamlessly integrated into the Streamlit application, allowing users to view and explore the data quality insights directly within the web interface.
